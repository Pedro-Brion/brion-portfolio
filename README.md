# Boid Simulation Portfolio

Welcome to my Boid Simulation Portfolio, a creative and interactive web experience designed to showcase my front-end development skills. I built this project using **Vue.js** and **Three.js**, featuring a real-time boid simulation running in the background. You can see it live here:

This portfolio aims to showcase my personal and profissional work, and serves as a demonstration of my technical skils. The boid simulation that runs on the background highlights my passion for blending creativity with code and my personal apreciation for 3d on the web.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

This project leverages the following technologies:

- **Vue 3** with _Composition API_,
- **Typescript**,
- **UnoCss**,
- **Sass** (CSS preprocessor),
- **Three.js**
- **Vite** for tooling and building the project.

## üê¶ Boid Simulation

The simulation follows the principles of boid behavior: **separation**, **alignment**, **cohesion** and a random noise to each boid. To handle the performance of simulating hundreds of boids, I implemented an **octree** for efficient spatial partitioning, enabling smooth flocking behavior even with a large number of agents.

Every frame, boids calculate their positions relative to their neighbors using spatial data from the octree, resulting resulting in fluid, lifelike movements.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Node.js and pnpm: Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/current) installed.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd brion-portfolio
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

4. Run

```bash
